----

- Modified directory structure to fit to setup.py/distutils
- Added setup.py and some scripts for deployment on PyPI

v0.5
----

- Enabled single-line and multi-line comments in grammars
- Extended AST construction to save matching substring also along the parse-tree
  with nodes representing nonterminals. This may be useful in some traversal
  functions.

- Introduced ParseError exception instead of error() function.
- Features the new libphorward-style BNF grammar definition language syntax
  (more about it can be obtained from https://bitbucket.org/codepilot/phorward)
- Enhanced pynetree.Node class to more utility functions for grabbing
  child nodes by kind and check for child node existence.
- Emitted tokens can now also be flagged in a dict-style grammar definition
  by preceding "@" to a symbol name, as it is the case in the BNF grammar.
- Added this changelog :)

v0.3
----

- Abstract Syntax Trees are build upon pynetree.Node objects now
- Bugfix on rule-emits, now storing a key within the pynetree.Node object for
  unique access
- Fixed the internal BNF traversal to new pynetree.Node
- Improved pynetree.Parser.traverse() function to allow for bottom-up,
  top-down and pass-by tree traversal.
- Updated README file to latest changes.
